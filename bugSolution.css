The best solution depends on the context. In some cases, you can avoid `calc()` entirely by using different approaches to achieve the desired layout.  However, if you must use `calc()`, try to make expressions as simple as possible. If percentages are involved, consider making sure the parent element's width is fully determined before the calculation is done.

One approach might be to use JavaScript to calculate the value and set the width via JavaScript.  Another might be to restructure your CSS to avoid complex `calc()` expressions.  Often, simpler CSS can lead to more predictable results.

Here's an example of using JavaScript to set the width:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.element');
const parentWidth = element.parentElement.offsetWidth;
const elementWidth = parentWidth * 0.5 - 10; //50% - 10px calculation
element.style.width = `${elementWidth}px`;
```

And here is an example with potentially more predictable CSS by avoiding `calc()`:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Example parent width */
}

.element {
  width: 240px; /* 50% - 10px  (assuming parent is 500px) */
}
```
